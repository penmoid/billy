// jest-dom adds custom jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
// allows you to do things like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)
// learn more: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom
// jest-dom is helpful for additional matchers in testing-library, but it's an optional dependency.
// Commented out to avoid requiring the package during tests in minimal environments.
// import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
